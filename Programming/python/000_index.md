## 8. Python for AI and Machine Learning

- **Core Libraries and Tools**: NumPy for array operations and numerical computing (vectorization, broadcasting, linear algebra functions); Pandas for data manipulation and analysis (DataFrames, Series, handling missing data, grouping, merging); Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization (plotting, histograms, scatter plots); Scikit-learn for classical ML algorithms (preprocessing, model selection, evaluation metrics); TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch for deep learning (tensors, neural networks, autograd).
- **Data Handling and Preprocessing**: Loading datasets (CSV, JSON); Cleaning data (handling NaNs, outliers); Feature engineering (scaling, encoding categorical variables, dimensionality reduction with PCA); Splitting data (train-test split, cross-validation) – critical for model reliability and avoiding overfitting.
- **Supervised Learning Algorithms**: Regression (linear, polynomial, logistic – predicting continuous/discrete outcomes, cost functions like MSE/MAE); Classification (decision trees for interpretable splits, random forests for ensemble boosting, SVM for margin maximization, Naive Bayes for probabilistic classification) – essential for predictive modeling in tasks like fraud detection or sentiment analysis.
- **Unsupervised Learning Algorithms**: Clustering (K-Means for partitioning, hierarchical for dendrograms); Association rules (Apriori for market basket analysis); Anomaly detection (isolation forests) – key for discovering patterns in unlabeled data, such as customer segmentation.
- **Reinforcement Learning Basics**: Markov decision processes; Q-learning and policy gradients; Environments and agents (using libraries like Gym) – fundamental for sequential decision-making in robotics or game AI.
- **Deep Learning Concepts**: Neural networks (feedforward, CNNs for image processing, RNNs/LSTMs for sequences); Backpropagation and optimization (gradient descent variants like Adam); Transfer learning and fine-tuning – enables handling complex data like images/speech, powering applications in computer vision and NLP.
- **Model Evaluation and Optimization**: Metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC); Hyperparameter tuning (grid search, random search); Bias-variance tradeoff; Overfitting prevention (regularization, dropout) – ensures models generalize well, vital for real-world deployment.
- **Advanced AI Topics**: Graph search algorithms (BFS, DFS, A\* for pathfinding); Knowledge representation and reasoning; Natural Language Processing (tokenization, embeddings with Word2Vec); Computer Vision basics (image augmentation, OpenCV integration) – builds intelligent systems for search, recommendation, and autonomous agents.
- **Applications and Ethics**: Building end-to-end projects (e.g., chatbots, image classifiers); AI ethics (bias mitigation, fairness); Deployment (using Flask/Docker for APIs) – ties concepts to practical impact, preparing for top scientific contributions.
